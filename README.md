- SmartIJ is an application (tools) which convert a board from a .pdf to a spreadsheet in .xlxs format (LibreOffice Calc / Word Excel)
- /!\ This application is made for Autocad user, I know they need to convert a .pdf file to a .xlsx file when they work !!

Tutorial : 
  - Separate all your pdf page one by one (which means if your .pdf file initally have 5 page, you're gonna end up with 5 differents .pdf files)
  - Convert each .pdf files to .txt file (very important for the reading)
  - Open the .txt file you want to use
  - Create a level (e.g: PH SS1, RDC ...)
  - Assign you level (very important)
  - Create a categorie (very important) 
  - Press the button (+) to add a Element
    -Write the Element you want to research (eg : Poteaux Béton Armé ep 10)
      -if(the Element if found) the programm is gonna write "Poteau Béton Armé ep 10, m² , 256 , PH SS1" in the categorie
  -The're is other features added to the application in the Menu Generate.
  
  -When you're done
    To generate a file, just go to Generate > Generate File and save it
